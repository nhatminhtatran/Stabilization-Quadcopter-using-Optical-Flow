# Robotics Project
Research, construct and Implement Quadcopter Stabilization Algorithm by Optical Flow and PID controller

In this project, we use Camera Logitech C270 to apply Optical Flow to calculate drift from the Center of Frame and TF-Lunar 1D Lidar to calculate height of Quadcopter. After that, we use that two-signal to control Quadcopter through two PID-controller. The protocol we use controll Quadcopter is YAMSPy(Yet Another Multiwii protocol).
